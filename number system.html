        <h1>number system</h1>
        <p>A number system is a writing system for denoting numbers logically using digits or other symbols. It provides a unique representation of every number and reflects the arithmetic and algebraic structure of numbers. In computing, several number systems are utilized:

<br>
Decimal (Base-10): The standard system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers, using digits from 0 to 9.
<br>
Binary (Base-2): Utilized internally by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices because it is straightforward to implement with digital electronic circuitry. It uses only two digits: 0 and 1.
<br>
Octal (Base-8): Uses digits from 0 to 7. Each octal digit represents three binary digits, making it more compact for representing binary numbers.
<br>
Hexadecimal (Base-16): Uses digits from 0 to 9 and letters A to F. Each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits, providing a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values.
Understanding these systems is crucial for tasks such as data representation, memory addressing, and low-level programming</p>
<h2>boolean algebra</h2>
<p>Boolean algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with variables that have two distinct values: 
    true and false, typically denoted as 1 and 0, respectively. It forms the foundation of digital logic and
     is essential for designing and understanding computer circuits and algorithms. Key concepts include:
      Logical Operations: AND, OR, and NOT operations that define how binary variables interact. Truth Tables:
       Tables that list all possible values of logical variables and the result of applying logical operations to them.
        Simplification of Expressions: Techniques like De Morgan's laws and Karnaugh maps are used to simplify complex 
        Boolean expressions, optimizing digital circuits. Proficiency in Boolean algebra is vital for tasks
     such as circuit design, algorithm optimization, and understanding the underlying principles of computer operations.</p>
<h2>Uses of binary number system</h2>
<p>The binary number system is the base of all computing systems and operations. It enables devices to store, access and manipulate all types of information directed to and from the CPU or memory. This makes it possible to develop applications that enable users to do the following:
<br>
view websites;<br>
create and update documents;<br>
play games;<br>
view streaming video and other kinds of graphical information;<br>
access software;<br>
perform calculations and data analysis <br>
The binary schema of digital 1s and 0s offers a simple and elegant way for computers to work. It also offers an efficient way to control logic circuits and to detect an electrical signal's true (1) and false (0) states.</p>
 <h2>rules for binary addition</h2>
 <p>Binary addition is a process of adding two binary numbers. The rules for binary addition are: <br>
0 + 0 = 0 <br>
0 + 1 = 1 <br>
1 + 0 = 1 <br>
1 + 1 = 10 (This is where you "carry" over the 1, similar to decimal addition.) <br>
