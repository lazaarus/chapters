    <h1>Programming concepts</h1>
    <p>To communicate with the computer is to develop a third language- a language that can be understood by both you and the computer. This is what a programming language is, A set of rules that provides a way of instructing the computer to perform certain operations. A computer needs instructions to follow because it cannot think on its own. For instance, when playing a game of solitare you must chose which card to move. These instructions compose only a small part of the solitare program. This program comprises many more instructions that allow a user to perform actions, such as begnining or ending a game, seleecting card's color, and so forth.
         Therefore, a computer program comprises instructions that direct the actions of the computer.</p>
<p>types of programming language: <br>
    1. machine level language <br>
    2. assembly language <br>
    3. high level language</p>
    <p>How does machine level language work?</p>
    <p>Machine-level language operates at the hardware level. Here's a simplified overview of how it works: <br>

Fetch: The CPU fetches an instruction from memory. <br>
Decode: The CPU decodes the instruction to determine the operation to perform. <br>
Execute: The CPU executes the instruction, such as adding two numbers or moving data. <br>
Store: The result of the operation is stored in memory or a register.</p>
<h2>assembly language</h2>
<p>Assembly-level language is a low-level programming language that is closely related to machine language. It uses mnemonics (short, human-readable codes) to represent machine-level instructions. Each mnemonic corresponds to a specific machine instruction, making it easier for programmers to write and understand low-level code.</p>
<p>Characteristics of Assembly Language: <br>
Hardware-Specific: Each CPU architecture has its own assembly language. <br>
Human-Readable: Uses mnemonics like MOV, ADD, and JMP instead of binary. <br>
Direct Control: Provides precise control over hardware resources. <br>
Efficiency: Programs written in assembly language are highly optimized for performance.</p>
<h2>high level language</h2>
<p>High-level languages are programming languages that are closer to human language and further from machine 
    language. They provide a high level of abstraction from hardware, making them easier to learn and use. 
    Examples include Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript.</p>

    <p>Characteristics of high level language</p>
    <p>Characteristics of High-Level Languages: <br>
Readability: Syntax is similar to human language. <br>
Portability: Programs can run on different platforms with minimal changes. <br>
Abstraction: Hides low-level details like memory management. <br>
Productivity: Faster development compared to low-level languages.</p>

<h1>Programming in C</h1>
<p>Programming in C is a fundamental skill for any aspiring programmer. C is a high-level language that is 
    a base for many languages in computer.
    C is a general-purpose language that can be used for a wide range of applications.
</p>
<p>C programming contains different types of variables, operators, control structures, functions, arrays, and pointers.
    It allows user to create problem solving programs easily. C programming has many keywords that has a different meaning 
    and can't be used in as a variable or a constant.
