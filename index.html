    <h1>introduction</h1>
    <p>Computer is an electronic device derived from the Latin word "computere," which means to calculate. It processes input, stores it, and produces meaningful output through an output device, following the Input-Process-Output (IPO) cycle. Computers rely on the principle of GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out), emphasizing that the output is only as good as the input.
<br> Characteristics of a computer include:</p>
<h2>speed</h2>
<p>Computers execute instructions at remarkable speeds, capable of processing millions or even billions of calculations in a single second. 
    This high speed allows them to handle complex tasks such as simulations, calculations, and data analysis in a fraction of the time it would take a human. 
    This makes computers an essential tool in fields like scientific research, finance, and gaming, where time-sensitive decisions are crucial.
    </p>
<h2>accuracy</h2>
<p>Computers are designed to perform operations with unparalleled precision.
     They can process and compute large volumes of data without human error, provided the software is properly coded. 
     The accuracy of computers ensures that tasks like mathematical calculations, data processing, and simulations are completed correctly, 
     reducing the chances of mistakes that are common in manual processes. As a result, industries like banking,
      healthcare, and engineering rely heavily on computer systems for error-free operations.
</p>
<h2>Storage</h2>
<p>Computers have the ability to store vast amounts of data, both in the short-term.
     Primary storage, such as RAM, provides quick access to data that is needed during active tasks, 
     while secondary storage like hard drives, SSDs, and cloud storage provide larger capacities for saving long-term data.
 </p>
 <h2>diligent</h2>
 <p>Computers can work continuously without getting tired or feeling fatigued. They can perform tasks repeatedly untill it is provided with instruction.
</p>
<h2>Types of computer on the basis of size</h2>
<p>
    Microcomputers: <br>
Microcomputers, or personal computers, are designed for individual use. They are compact, affordable, and versatile. Examples include desktops, laptops, smartphones,
 and tablets, which are used for tasks like word processing, web browsing, gaming, and multimedia consumption.
 <br>
 Minicomputers: <br>
Minicomputers, also known as mid-range computers, are more powerful than microcomputers and can support multiple users simultaneously. They 
are used in small to medium-sized businesses for applications like database management and industrial control systems. <br>
Mainframes: <br>
Mainframes are large, high-performance computers used by large organizations to process and manage massive amounts of data. They are essential
 for tasks like banking systems, airline reservations, and government databases, supporting thousands of users at once.
 <br>
 Supercomputers: <br>
Supercomputers are the most powerful computers, designed to solve complex problems that require immense computational power. They are used in fields like scientific research,
 weather forecasting, and artificial intelligence. Examples include Fugaku in Japan and Summit in the United States.
